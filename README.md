##### _Demonstration of Histogram Specification for Image Composition_

This is a companion project to the histogram section of my book, [_Core Image for Swift_](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/core-image-for-swift/id1073029980?mt=13). The project demonstrates applying a histogram from an image of some fruit to The Mona Lisa and compositing the two images together.
